# ðŸš€ Blockchain-Crypto ðŸš€
    An illustration of blockchain and crypto technology by:
    - building my own very VERY simple form of Cryptocurrency (like bitcoin), 
    - smart contracts, crypto-wallets and even transfer some crypto we just created  
    - using Javascript and and typescript. This project was to give Pentesters,
      and hackers a basic view of Crypto's inner workings. Also this project
    - can be incorporated into a CTF. Have fun.
